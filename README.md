Grocery Management System

A grocery shopping is an android application where users can purchase and order groceries online. The system is developed with a user-friendly and attractive GUI. It delivers a wide range of groceries available online.

My app does it, but with a twisted approach.My app holds the KISS(KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID) principle which helps our app to reach the benchmark of simplicity and easy to use. In this Application works with CRUD(CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DELETE) operation. It's lightweight in nature and it can operate on 96% of mobile systems.
